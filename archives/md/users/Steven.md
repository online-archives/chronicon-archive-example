It may not be the cleanest way to do it, but add these lines in Desktop css
    
    
    .topic-list-data.num.views {

    }

There already is a excerpt reference, so you might want to delete line 16 first
    
    
      {{raw "list/topic-excerpt" topic=model}}
    

Then, I would add this
    
    
      {{#if expandPinned...

It’s a little bug, it will be fixed soon.

If you want to fix it until then, you just need to edit the theme and in the Desktop > Header part, change the code with this

topic-body has his own width setting.

Default:
    
    
    .topic-body {
        width: calc(690px + (11px * 2));

You can edit the theme in the `Header` section

And replace it all with this:
    
    
    <script type='text/x-handlebars' data-template-name='list/topic-list-item.raw'>
    
    {{#if bulkSelectEna...

I don’t use the theme, but my guess is:
    
    
    button.create .d-icon {
        color: #000;
    }
    

If it mess with other buttons, use this line instead
    
    
    #topic-footer-buttons ...
